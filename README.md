# OTiM2R
Topology:
(1) nx.draw(G, pos=nx.spring_layout(G), with_labels=True, node_color='y') Because the node position is undetermined in advance, "pos" can not limit the node position. The topology is different in each time generation. 

(2) ns.qubits.operators.CNOT/H/Z/I/S/T is just for two-qubits entanglement, not for multiple qubits.
